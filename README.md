# Journal #1, lets talk about *Robocalls*

  You recieve a phonecall from a number you may or may not know, you answer and it is a robotic voice trying to promote a product, presetn you with information, or give you an opinion you do not care to hear. if You experience this, you would be dealing with a **robocall**. 

## What exaclty is a robocall?

  A robocall is a commonly used method of conveying information to people worldwide. Almost everyone has a smart phone or at the least some sort of telephone which can be reached, making robocalls extremely effective. They are often used for harmless reminders such as appointment reminders or flight cancellations, perscription filling, and more. _However_, as the utility of these calls have been realized, robcalls have been exposed to much corruption. The Federal Trade Comission states the following on robocalls (SEE SOURCES): "If you answer the phone and hear a recorded message instead of a live person, it's a robocall. If you’re getting a lot of robocalls trying to sell you something, odds are the calls are illegal. Many are also probably scams." 
  
 ## The Robo behind the call.

  These scam calls are often entirely computerized, and are sent out on a mass scale to millions every day due to their ease of use and low costs. Like many other computer programs, A robocall has an algorithm, that is, "A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end" (per [Algorithm definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm)). Many robocalls use whats called an outbound phone call system. "Outbound automated phone systems work by accepting bulk input of telephone numbers, usually from a computer drive or database. Using a bank of telephone lines, the systems place calls and listen for answers; when the systems detect a human answer, they either play a pre-recorded message or connect the dialed party with an available human agent. Inbound systems work like outbound systems, but in reverse. These systems, typically operated by computers, answer incoming calls. The systems typically play a message, then ask the caller to either press a button or speak a response. Depending on the caller’s input, the automated phone system may play some information, route the caller to another prompt or connect the caller with a human operator." (SEE SOURCES).
  

Like many other algorithms, these calls try to achieve a goal by guiding the recipient through multiple steps. At their core, these algorithms are not unlike many of the algorithmically derived texts we see in our everyday life, such as [Exquisite Corpse Writing](https://poets.org/text/play-exquisite-corpse) or the Telephone game. A end goal is desired, and steps are taken to reach it. In exquisite corpse, Each participant contributes, and then passes the text on, until a story is created. The telephone game requires players to write down what they hear fro m the previous person, the result usually being a warped version of the original statement. Algorithms such as these are powerful in that achieving goals become much easier for computer systems.

## LETS HEAR ONE!

[This phone call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hySSXaDaEY0) is an example of a robocall with an algotithm, the recepient is asked questions, in which certain expected responses help move the phonecall along, step by step. You can see how when asked questions not pertaining to the algorithm set in place, the AI of the phonecall breaks down and resorts to specifically engineered responses. This is similar to text based algorithms like exquisite corpse such that it can be hard to piece together a story if the next person does not continue the sentence that the last person left open ended. It destroys the algorithm.


As robocall AI gets smarter and smarter, more complex algorithms will be worked into them to ensure either ease of use for commercial use, or more believable scams from illegal calls. Even A simple algorithm like Telephone can be helpful in helping computers learn how conversations become warped and off topic so the robocall can reconviene the conversation back to whatever the point of the call was. As the robocall epidemic gets worse, it will be interesting to see how they evolve and combat regulations with increasingly accurate and misleading algorithms.
