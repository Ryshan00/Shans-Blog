# Lets talk about the wonderful world of *Robocalls*

  You pick up the phone only to hear a robotic voice remind you of something you scheduled months ago, sell you something ridiculous, possibly something you have never heard of, or promote their campaign for political office. If you have experienced this (which it is likely that you have) you are dealing with a Robocall, and no, your social security number is not compromised.

## What exaclty is a robocall?

   A robocall is a method of conveying information to people worldwide. Almost everyone has a smart phone or at the least some sort of telephone which can be reached, making robocalls extremely effective. They are commonly used for harmless reminders such as appointment reminders or flight cancellations, perscription filling, and more. _However_, as the utility of these calls have been realized, robcalls have been exposed to much corruption. The Federal Trade Comission states the following on robocalls (SEE SOURCES): "If you answer the phone and hear a recorded message instead of a live person, it's a robocall. If you’re getting a lot of robocalls trying to sell you something, odds are the calls are illegal. Many are also probably scams."
  
## The Robo Behind The Call
 
 
 ![ALGORITHMS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54897843/64924303-f79d2e00-d7b0-11e9-86ce-c4820c0ab63f.jpg)   
 
   These scam calls are often entirely computerized, and are sent out on a mass scale to millions every day due to their ease of use and low costs. Like many other computer programs, A robocall has an algorithm, that is, "A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end" (per [Algorithm definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm)). Many robocalls use whats called an outbound phone call system. "Outbound automated phone systems work by accepting bulk input of telephone numbers, usually from a computer drive or database. Using a bank of telephone lines, the systems place calls and listen for answers; when the systems detect a human answer, they either play a pre-recorded message or connect the dialed party with an available human agent. Inbound systems work like outbound systems, but in reverse. These systems, typically operated by computers, answer incoming calls. The systems typically play a message, then ask the caller to either press a button or speak a response. Depending on the caller’s input, the automated phone system may play some information, route the caller to another prompt or connect the caller with a human operator." (SEE SOURCES).
  

   Like many other algorithms, these calls try to achieve a goal by guiding the recipient through multiple steps. At their core, these algorithms are not unlike many of the algorithmically derived texts we see in common writing exercises. An algorithmically derived text is a means of text generation which uses, as the name entails, and algorithm. You can find these in common writing exercises such as [Exquisite Corpse Writing](https://poets.org/text/play-exquisite-corpse) or the Telephone game. A end goal is desired, and steps are taken to reach it. In exquisite corpse, Each participant contributes, and then passes the text on, until a story is created. In the telephone game, players can write down what they hear from the previous person, the result usually being a warped version of the original statement given. Everyone has to follow the steps accurately, lest problems will arise and fill the experience with inconsistency.

## Speaking of Robocalls, LETS HEAR ONE!


![ROBOCALL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54897843/64924329-45b23180-d7b1-11e9-8e9b-2c720fb6500f.png)


   [This phone call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hySSXaDaEY0) is an example of a robocall with an algorithm, the recepient is asked questions, in which certain expected responses help move the phonecall along, step by step. You can see how when asked questions not pertaining to the algorithm set in place, the AI of the phonecall breaks down and resorts to specifically engineered responses. This is similar to text based algorithms like exquisite corpse such that it can be hard to piece together a story if the next person does not continue the sentence that the last person left open ended. It destroys the **algorithm**.


   As robocall AI gets smarter and smarter, more complex algorithms will be worked into them to ensure either ease for commercial use, or more believable scams from illegal calls. Even A simple algorithm like Telephone has been helpful in teaching computers simple step by step flow. Computers are constantly learning, and as the robocall epidemic gets worse, it will be interesting to see how they evolve and combat regulations with increasingly accurate and potentially corrupt algorithms.

# The Oregon Trail and The Text Based Computer Game

## The Rise of Text Based Games
Text based computer games have been around in their simplest forms since the 1960's, but reached peak popularity in the middle of the 1970's and were commonplace all the way into the 90's. Games like Stationfall and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are among the most famous text based game offerings ever released. Text based games can and often do cover many different genres, spanning fantasy, sci-fi, the wild west, and many more. The famous text based game "The Oregon Trail" is an example of the latter.

## The Oregon Trail
*The Oregon Trail* was an educational game released in 1985 and released on several other platforms and in many iterations up until the early 1990's, and It quickly became one of the most famous and successful text based games ever released. It is set in 19th century pioneer life along the Oregon Trail. You take the role of a wagon leader as you and your party try to make it from Missouri to new life in Oregon. The realism of the game soon becomes clear, however, as the harsh reality of the wagon trail lifestyle was translated exceptionally well into the game world.

## Gruesome Realism

The Oregon Trail was known for its realism, which in games at the time was not relatively common. Your party members can die to all sorts of things without warning, with an absurd attention to detail for the time. Typhoid Fever, Snakebites, accidental gunshot wounds, drowning, and perhaps the most famous of possible deaths, dysentery, all fall into this category. Amongst the death scenes were many possible things to do during the game, such as hunting, purchasing resources, and more.

## Outcomes, Adventure

The ability of the oregon trail to tell a compelling story filled with *CHOICE* given the limitations at the time was exceptional. Many text based choose-your-own-adventure style stories take inspiration from the many possibilities and branches of gameplay the oregon trail presents. Even today, the game stands as one of the pinnacle examples of its kind. The Oregon Trail can be played and enjoyed here: https://classicreload.com/oregon-trail.html

# Project Plans

For my final project in my Designing and Writing Interactive texts class, I will take on the mantle of *retroscripting / remixing*. To Retroscript is to take things from media, i.e. a movie script, comic book, video games, and create something new out of it using your own creativity. Popular examples of retroscripting include [Garfield Minus Garfield](https://garfieldminusgarfield.net/) and [3eanuts](https://3eanuts.com/) These display incredible creativity and that is something I wanted to replicate for my project.

## What will I be retroscripting?

My project plans is to to make a song out of other songs, with the lyrics fitting together to make a puzzle, not unlike the [*exquisite corpse game used in writing and drawing*](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-explaining-exquisite-corpse-surrealist-drawing-game-die). The public domain is full of everything you could need for this sort of project, so the plan is to take clips of music videos, or audio, whatever i can find, to create a song out of different songs. It could be quite comical to see the results, and id imagine there are an uncountable number of possibilities with this sort of project. 

### DUE DATE?

This project is due thursday, december 12th at Midnight, so time is limited on this project, but I believe this will become more about finding a good combination of clips to use, moreso than wondering how to set it up, because that is entirely at my discretion. Im excited to get to this project, as I have been browsing ideas in my head for awhile. We'll see how it turns out!
